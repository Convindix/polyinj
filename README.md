This is a program that searches for rational numbers a != c and b != d such that a^7+3b^7 = c^7 + 3d^7.

Don Zagier has speculated that this polynomial is injective on the rational numbers (see B. Poonen, "[Multivariable polynomial injections on rational numbers](https://arxiv.org/abs/0902.3961v2)", 2009), this program searches for a counterexample.
